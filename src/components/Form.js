		A dropdown for pizza size with an id of "size-dropdown"
		A checklist for toppings - at least 4 (hint: name each separately!)
		Text input for special instructions with an id of "special-text"
		An Add to Order button that has an id of "order-button" and that submits form and returns a database record of name, size, toppings and special instructions
		Data should look something like
		```
		{
				name: string,
				size: string,
				topping1: bool,
				topping2: bool,
				special: string,
		}

		where there is a key for name, size and special and they are strings
		and
		there is a key for each of the toppings and they are booleans
		(Note - your payload should look similar to the about data) */
